This respository hosts some work on porting Chameleon 
(http://isquaredsoftware.com/chameleon.php?page=Description) to a Linux 
environment.  I'm not actually interested in getting it to fully 
function, but I'm looking to extract the wxWidgets Terminal widget from 
it for general use.  However, since I have put in a bit of work towards 
making it work in linux, I figure I might offer it online for anyone who is interested.

Chameleon itself is offered under the GPL version 2 or later.  I am 
offering this repository under the same license terms.
